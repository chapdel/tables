## Getting started

### Single actions

Single action buttons are rendered at the end of each table row.

If you're using the actions in a Livewire component, you can put them in the `getTableActions()` method.

```php
protected function getTableActions(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
    ];
}
```

If you're using them in admin panel resources or relation managers, you must put them on the `$table`:

```php
public static function table(Table $table): Form
{
    return $table
        // Add the actions before the default action/s (before Edit or View)
        ->prependActions([
            // ...
        ])
        // Add the actions after the default action/s (after Edit or View)
        ->pushActions([
            // ...
        ])
        // Override the default action/s (instead of Edit or View)
        ->actions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its name. The name of the action should be unique. You can then pass a callback to `action()` which executes the task, or a callback to `url()` which generates a link URL:

> If you would like the URL to open in a new tab, you can use the `openUrlInNewTab()` method.

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\LinkAction;

LinkAction::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
```

### Bulk actions

Bulk action buttons are visible when the user selects at least one record.

If you're using the actions in a Livewire component, you can put them in the `getTableBulkActions()` method.

```php
protected function getTableBulkActions(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
    ];
}
```

If you're using them in admin panel resources or relation managers, you must put them on the `$table`:

```php
public static function table(Table $table): Form
{
    return $table
        // Add the actions before the default action (before Delete)
        ->prependBulkActions([
            // ...
        ])
        // Add the actions after the default action (after Delete)
        ->pushBulkActions([
            // ...
        ])
        // Override the default action (instead of Delete)
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Bulk actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its name. The name of the action should be unique. You should then pass a callback to `action()` which executes the task:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
```

You may deselect the records after a bulk action has been executed using the `deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
```

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the action is generated from its name. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\LinkAction;

LinkAction::make('edit')
    ->label('Edit post')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
```

## Setting a color

Actions may have a color to indicate their significance. It may be either `primary`, `secondary`, `success`, `warning` or `danger`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
    ->color('danger')
```

## Setting an icon

Bulk actions and some single actions may also render a Blade icon component to indicate their purpose:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ButtonAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\IconButtonAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
    ->color('danger')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-trash')

ButtonAction::make('edit')
    ->label('Edit post')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
    ->icon('heroicon-o-pencil')

IconButtonAction::make('edit')
    ->label('Edit post')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
    ->icon('heroicon-o-pencil')
```

## Modals

Actions and bulk actions may require additional confirmation or form information before they run. With the table builder, you may open a modal before an action is executed to do this.

### Confirmation modals

You may require confirmation before an action is run using the `requiresConfirmation()` method. This is useful for particularly destructive actions, such as those that delete records.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
    ->requiresConfirmation()
```

> Note: The confirmation modal is not available when a `url()` is set instead of an `action()`. Instead, you should redirect to the URL within the `action()` callback.

### Custom forms

You may also render a form in this modal to collect extra information from the user before the action runs.

You may use components from the [Form Builder](/docs/forms/fields) to create custom action modal forms. The data from the form is available in the `$data` array of the `action()` callback:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('updateAuthor')
    ->action(function (Collection $records, array $data): void {
        foreach ($records as $record) {
            $record->author()->associate($data['authorId']);
            $record->save();
        }
    })
    ->form([
        Forms\Components\Select::make('authorId')
            ->label('Author')
            ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
            ->required(),
    ])
```

### Setting a modal heading, subheading, and button label

You may customize the heading, subheading and button label of the modal:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->modalHeading('Delete posts')
    ->modalSubheading('Are you sure you\'d like to delete these posts? This cannot be undone.')
    ->modalButton('Yes, delete them')
```

## Authorization

You may conditionally hide actions and bulk actions for certain users using the `hidden()` method, passing a closure:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\LinkAction;

LinkAction::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
    ->hidden(fn (Post $record): bool => auth()->user()->can('update', $record))
```

This is useful for authorization of certain actions to only users who have permission.

## Alignment

By default, the row actions in your table will be aligned to the right in the final cell. To change the default alignment, update the configuration value inside of the package config:

```
'action_alignment' => 'right', // `right`, `left` or `center`
```
